# To build the jasper libraries for use with Dragon:
# (Note that this only needs to be done once, or if it is
# desired to update the version.)

# 1. Checkout jasper-1.900.1.zip (or newer version) from CVS, and unpack
# it into this directory
#   [ -d jasper*0 ] && rm -r jasper*.zip
   unzip jasper-1.900.1.zip

# 2. 
   [ -d lib/$PLATFORM/bin ] || mkdir -p lib/$PLATFORM/bin
   [ -d lib/$PLATFORM/lib ] || mkdir lib/$PLATFORM/lib
   [ -d lib/$PLATFORM/include ] || mkdir lib/$PLATFORM/include
   if [ x$PLATFORM = xlinux ]; then
     [ -d lib/man/man1 ] || mkdir -p lib/man/man1
     [ -d lib/doc ] || mkdir lib/doc
   fi

# 3. 
#   change into the jasper-1.900.1 directory and run
   cd jasper-*
   cp LICENSE ../lib/doc 
   ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/../lib --exec-prefix=`pwd`/../lib/$PLATFORM --includedir=`pwd`/../lib/$PLATFORM/include

#4. run
   make 
   make install
     # the jas*.h are excluded. Why? Maybe 'make install' copied them already
   find . -name "[a-ik-z]*.h" -exec cp {} ../lib/$PLATFORM/include \;
   find . -name "jp*.h" -exec cp {} ../lib/$PLATFORM/include \;
   find . -name "jasper.h" -exec cp {} ../lib/$PLATFORM/include \;
   cp -pR doc/*.pdf ../lib/doc

# This will put the include files in vendors/jasper/lib/$PLATFORM/include
#               the libraries in vendors/jasper/lib/{linux|mingw}/lib
#               the executables in vendors/jasper/lib/{linux|mingw}/bin

echo ""
echo "Check the libraries (-kb) and include files into cvs"
