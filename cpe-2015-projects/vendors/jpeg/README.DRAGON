#added special steps for jpeg
#
#To build the jpeg libraries for use with Dragon:
#(Note that this only needs to be done once, or if it is
#desired to update the version.)
#
#1. Checkout jpeg-6b.tar.gz (or newer version) from CVS, and unpack
#it into this directory
   tar -xvzf jpeg*z
#2. 
   [ -d lib ] || mkdir lib
   [ -d lib/$PLATFORM ] || mkdir lib/$PLATFORM
   [ -d lib/$PLATFORM/bin ] || mkdir lib/$PLATFORM/bin
   [ -d lib/$PLATFORM/lib ] || mkdir lib/$PLATFORM/lib
   [ -d lib/$PLATFORM/include ] || mkdir lib/$PLATFORM/include
   [ -d lib/man ] || mkdir lib/man
   [ -d lib/man/man1 ] || mkdir lib/man/man1
   [ -d lib/doc ] || mkdir lib/doc

#3. 
#   change into the jpeg-6b directory and run
   cd jpeg-* 
   ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/../lib --exec-prefix=`pwd`/../lib/$PLATFORM --includedir=`pwd`/../$PLATFORM/include

#4. run
     # (in mingw, the apps will probably fail to build)
     make || make install
     cp *.a ../lib/$PLATFORM/lib
     cp -p *.h ../lib/$PLATFORM/include
     cp -p README ../lib/README.jpeg
     cp -p *.doc ../lib/doc

# This will put the include files in vendors/jpeg/lib/include
#              the libraries in vendors/jpeg/lib/{linux|mingw}/lib
#              the executables in vendors/jpeg/lib/{linux|mingw}/bin
#
@echo "The include files are initially put into platform-specific locations"
@echo "If there are no differences, merge them into lib/include"
@echo "Check the libraries (-kb) and include files into cvs"
