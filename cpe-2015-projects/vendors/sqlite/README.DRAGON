# added special steps for geotiff

# To build the sqllite libraries for use with Dragon:
# (Note that this only needs to be done once, or if it is
# desired to update the version.)

# 1. Checkout sqlite*gz (or newer version) from CVS, and unpack
# it into this directory

# 2. Create some subdirectories
    mkdir lib
    mkdir lib/linux
    mkdir lib/mingw
    mkdir lib/include

# 3. Make sure PLATFORM is set to 'linux' or 'mingw' as appropriate
#    change into the libgeotiff-1.2.2 directory and run
    cd sqlite; pwd; \
    rm config.status; \
    ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/../lib --exec-prefix=`pwd`/../lib/$PLATFORM || exit 

# 4. run Make (in mingw, the apps will probably fail to build)
    make clean
    make 
    make install
