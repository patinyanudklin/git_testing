#To build the proj4 libraries for use with Dragon:

#1. Checkout proj-4.4.9.zip from CVS, and unpack it into this directory
   unzip proj*

#2. 
   mkdir lib
   mkdir lib/linux
   mkdir lib/mingw

#3. 
# This builds the executables with static libraries for 32-bit processors
#   change into the proj* directory and run
      cd proj*
      export CFLAGS=-m32 && ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/../lib \
         --exec-prefix=`pwd`/../lib/$PLATFORM CFLAGS=-static  

#4. run
     make
     make check
     make install
#     you can then delete the proj* directory

#This will put the include files in vendors/libtiff/lib/include 
#              the libraries in vendors/libtiff/lib/{linux|mingw}/lib 
#              the executables in vendors/libtiff/lib/{linux|mingw}/bin

#after building them, check the libraries into cvs
