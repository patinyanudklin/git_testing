#To build the shapelib library for use with Dragon:

#1. Checkout shapelib-1.2.10 from CVS, and unpack it into this directory

#2. change into the shapelib-1.2.10 directory and run make
    cd shapelib-1.2.10
    make
    
#3. Change back to this directory and run make
    cd ..
    make

#4. You can then delete the shapelib-1.2.10 directory

#This will put the include files in vendors/shapelib/lib/include 
#              the libraries in vendors/shapelib/lib/{linux|mingw}/lib 
#              the executables in vendors/shapelib/lib/{linux|mingw}/bin

#after building them, check the libraries into cvs
