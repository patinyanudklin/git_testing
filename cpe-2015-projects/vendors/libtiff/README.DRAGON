#To build the libtiff libraries for use with Dragon:

#1. Checkout tiff-3.7.2.tgz from CVS, and unpack it into this directory

#2. 
   mkdir lib
   mkdir lib/linux
   mkdir lib/mingw

#3. 
#   change into the tiff-3.7.2 directory and run
      cd tiff-3.7.2
      ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/../lib --exec-prefix=`pwd`/../lib/$PLATFORM \
	--disable-zlib --disable-jpeg --disable-pixarlog

#4. run
#     make
#     make install
#     you can then delete the tiff-3.7.2 directory

#This will put the include files in vendors/libtiff/lib/include 
#              the libraries in vendors/libtiff/lib/{linux|mingw}/lib 
#              the executables in vendors/libtiff/lib/{linux|mingw}/bin

#after building them, check the libraries into cvs
